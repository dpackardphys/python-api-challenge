### Analysis conclusions
  1. There is a strong correlation between max temp and latitude, for both southern and norther hemispheres, with higher temperatures closer to latitude = 0, and lower temperatures closer to the Earth's poles, as we expect due to the increased amount of sunlight the equator receives throughout the year.
  2. There are only weak and inconclusive correlations between latitude and the other types of weather data, which is expected due to the many more complex factors involved in determining humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed in real weather systems.
  3. Ideal vacation spots tend to be near large bodies of water or deserts!
